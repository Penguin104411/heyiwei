					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>UCL Information Management for Business student and hands-on technologist with strong writing and presentation skills (IELTS 7.5). I combine systems thinking with practical build-and-ship experience—from web pages and data stories to lab experiments. Recently, I served as corresponding author on a peer-reviewed review article about AI in finance, focusing on deployment, risk and governance, which sharpened my literature synthesis, evaluation, and stakeholder-oriented communication.</p>

					<h2>Conference Paper — <a href='https://www.ewadirect.com/proceedings/ace/article/view/29153'>The Landscape of Modern AI in Finance (Corresponding Author)</a></h2>
					<p class="subDetails">July 2025 - September 2025</p>
					<p>Mapped methods to applications in investment, risk, customer analytics and RegTech. Summarised failure modes—privacy and data availability issues, label scarcity, drift, out-of-distribution cases, and miscalibration—and the governance toolkit: model risk management, fairness, dataset lineage and version control, and continuous monitoring. Delivered a practical deployment checklist: data contracts, interpretable or monotonic constraints when appropriate, robustness testing and probability calibration, causal and counterfactual evaluation, plus institution-level ML and LLM operations to move systems from usable to trustworthy at scale.

					<h2>Research Essay — Tesla Full Self-Driving: Do the Benefits Outweigh the Challenges? (UCL UPC Research Project)</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Feburary 2025 - May 2025</p>
					<p>Reviewed Tesla's pure-vision FSD stack (HydraNet, fleet learning, Dojo and over-the-air updates) and the evidence on safety, efficiency and economic impact. Set these against ethical dilemmas such as the trolley problem and cross-cultural preferences, assessed liability models—driver responsibility, manufacturer responsibility and shared approaches—together with GDPR-grade privacy requirements and the need for AI transparency. Synthesised sources including NHTSA crash data and the Moral Machine experiments into a balanced view: the benefits likely outweigh the challenges when strong governance is in place, including event data recorders for investigations, shared-liability insurance, and practical explainability with continuous monitoring.

					<h2>Conference Paper — <a href='https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/3194/1/030017/3325233/Research-on-recommender-systems-based-on-GCN'>Recommender Systems based on GCN (Co-author)</a></h2>
					<p class="subDetails">September 2023 - Janurary 2024</p>
					<p>Benchmarked multiple GCN variants on Yelp2018 and Amazon-Book. Investigated three pain points: data sparsity, neighbour-relation heterogeneity, and the role of feature transforms and non-linearities. Reported Recall@20 and NDCG@20 with distilled takeaways (GCN-SSL strongest on sparse Amazon-Book; IMPGCN-STL on Yelp2018; IcaGCN for neighbour weighting; UltraGCN for efficiency) and outlined next steps on augmentation, adaptive weighting and scalable training.
